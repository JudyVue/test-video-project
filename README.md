# How to Run Judy Vue's Code Challenge

#### This project was made courtesy to the awesome folks who created [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) and this [excellent YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eWrpsCLMJQ&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhBRAgFinJR8KHIrCdTkZcZ).
* If you do not have [**Node**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your machine, please do that first before trying to run this project, or else, you'll just be terribly confused.
* Install [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) globally on your machine
* If you're reading this, you're proabably in the `test-video` directory. Great! Now travel into the `video-project` directory. 
* In a command line of your choice, be sure you're in the root of `video-project` and type in the command `npm i`.
* If you haven't fallen asleep yet waiting for dependencies to load, type the command `ng serve`.
* The project is now running at **localhost:4200**.
